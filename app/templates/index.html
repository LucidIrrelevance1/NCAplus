                        In some instances there is a interest in using ACI simply as a network Layer 2 transport. This
                        model wants to take advantage of the many operational capabilities of ACI yet not
                        implement the full functionality of the Application Profile structures and security constructs of ACI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this reason this tool was developed to assist in the creation of these policies in ACI. By taking a
                        traditional classical ethernet approach, the tool builds the policies in ACI to match a working solution
                        in this integration model. Focused on purely extending the layer 2 network the tool provides the ability to
                        create the networks and associate them to specific interfaces, port channels and virtual port channels in the
                        ACI fabric.

                        The following diagram shows a brownfield environment that has a classical core, distribution and access layer
                        for which we are attaching a new ACI fabric. NCAPlus can create the networks that are described in this
                        picture to extend the layer2 connection into the fabric.

                        The tool can also permit the grouping of these networks under groups. These groups are translated into
                        Tenants in the ACI fabric. These can translate into future administrative domains for the fabric admin
                        in managing overall network health scores.
